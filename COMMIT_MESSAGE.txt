feat: implement form data persistence with auto-save

Add localStorage-based form data persistence across all forms with:
- 500ms debounce for efficient saving
- 7-day TTL with automatic cleanup
- Silent background operation (no UI feedback)
- Restore data after page refresh
- Clear data on successful form submission

New utilities:
- src/utils/localStorageHelper.ts - Core storage with TTL
- src/hooks/useFormPersistence.ts - React Hook Form integration

Forms updated:
- check-foliepas
- intake-vlos, intake-osa, intake-osb, intake-pulman
- intake-rebacare, intake-steunzolen
- new-client, old-client

App initialization updated:
- src/pages/_app.tsx - Auto cleanup on mount
