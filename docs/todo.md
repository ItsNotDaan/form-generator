1.  <!-- Redo the whole folder structure in this project when talking about constants, scripts and stuff like that. Formdata, formconstant, scrips they all have a totally different place. I would like to make this whole project more cleaned up.

Maybe it would be better IF possible! to add all the generation and things needed together to be in form-result.

For other files create a good project mapping structure. formData and formConstants for example can be together. also check if some files maybe can be merged.

I think you get what i want. A clean, organized, structured project. Files not needed can be removed.
Build and test the project at the end. -->
